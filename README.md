## Technologies Used
HTML,
BOOTSTRAP,
JQUERY 
Git 
Markdown

## BDD
The project runs in the visual studio code. Download the jquery plugin from the jquery cdn then run it inside a script tag. Why was this framework chosen? With jquery, alot of javaScript functionality can be achieved with very few lines of code and in addition, it is very precise and easy to use and apply.

## Project Objectives
The project will be evaluated based on the following objectives:

The project code uses constructors in Javascript. The project makes use of prototypes in Javascript. The project implements one or more Javascript functions. The project separates the business logic code from the UI logic code. The web app uses bootstrap and media queries to make it fully responsive. The javascript code uses the correct syntax of camel case naming of variables. I.e var myVariable = "stores something"; instead of var my_var = "stores something", or, var MyVar = "stores something" , or, var my-Var = "stores something"

## Credits
Many thanks to w3schools documentation and freecodecamp for availing resources online. I found their resources very useful throughout the course of my project. Their efforts in availing the resources was very instrumental in the success of my project. I would choose them over again and recommend any individual to check on their resources whenever they'd want anything code related.
